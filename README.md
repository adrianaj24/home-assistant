# Haven - Home Assistant WebApp

Haven is an open source Smart Home app built to automate and control common household processes. The first feature implementation of the app is a video feed from a camera that can be placed anywhere in your home. Our users can enter our application and start the live stream to see the feed. Further, a user can also view previous video footage that is saved in the appâ€™s Amazon s3 storage.
